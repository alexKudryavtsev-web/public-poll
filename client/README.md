# Public Polls

**_Public polls_**. This is a service for conducting sociological surveys. In it, you can create questionnaires and receive data with them. The closest analogue is Yandex Form.

Usage logic:

- The user creates a questionnaire from two available elements: the choice of one value and text input.
- The user receives a link through which you can go and answer all the questions posed in the questionnaire. He distributes it.
- Outsiders go through the link and do it. To prevent one person from answering the same form multiple times, they must enter their email address.
- After some time, the user can stop the survey and get data for analysis.
